  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <h3>What is this website?</h3>
  <p>
    This website is a platform dedicated to sharing guitar tabs for my favorite songs,
    with a particular focus on music from the BanG Dream. While BanG Dream songs
    make up a significant portion of the content, I also upload tabs for other
    songs that I personally enjoy.
  </p>
  <h3>How to download the tab?</h3>
  <p>Just choose the song you want to download and click <b>Download</b> button.</p>
  <h3>How to open the file?</h3>
  <p>
    The file format is <code>.gp</code> and you can open it with
    <a href="https://www.guitar-pro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guitar Pro</a>
    with minimum version of 7. Alternatively you can use
    <a href="https://www.soundslice.com/guitar-pro-viewer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SoundSlice</a>
    to view the tab.
  </p>
  <h3>How about the PDF file?</h3>
  <p>Sorry, but I won't upload PDF files.</p>
  <h3>Are these tabs accurate?</h3>
  <p>
    I don't know, I think the sound maybe 99% accurate because I transcribed all by
    listening the slowed version of the song using Audacity. However, the finger placement
    on the fretboard may different from the original. Nonetheless, I always try my best
    to deliver the best tabs to you.
  </p>
  <h3>Is this website frequently updated?</h3>
  <p>No, sorry. At the moment I lost my motivation to do this kind of thing.</p>
